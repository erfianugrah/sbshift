 * Live readiness checks promoted from `doctor`'s inline control flow to data. Each is a
 * single-row SQL probe + an expected value; doctor runs them via `runCheck` and renders its
 * existing pass/fail strings, while `guide`'s future live walk runs the same items. Grounded
 * in the Postgres docs (docs.erfi.io) so `kb drift` can age-check them.
 *
 * Extraction is incremental and output-preserving: a check moves here only when doctor's
 * emitted strings stay byte-identical (see test/integration.test.ts).
