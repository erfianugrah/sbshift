/**
 * Knowledge base for Postgres major-version upgrade rehearsal (the pg_upgrade path).
 *
 * Pure data + pure functions + SQL text constants only - every export is
 * unit-testable without a database. Grounded in the Supabase platform upgrade
 * guide (/docs/guides/platform/upgrading) and the Postgres release notes:
 *
 *  - Platform prerequisites: read replicas deleted first, logical replication
 *    slots dropped, reg* columns referencing system OIDs removed,
 *    deprecated/unsupported extensions dropped.
 *  - PG17 deprecates plcoffee / plls / plv8 / timescaledb / pgjwt (pgjwt was
 *    enabled by default on every project up to PG15 - "most likely safe to
 *    disable" if the app never calls sign()/verify()).
 *  - pg_cron is dropped + recreated during the platform upgrade and
 *    cron.job_run_details is duplicated first - prune it or the disk pressure
 *    can fail the upgrade.
 *  - Custom roles on md5 passwords must be moved to scram-sha-256.
 *  - ltree indexes may need a reindex (multibyte encoding / non-libc collation).
 *  - Non-built-in operator selectivity estimators now need superuser to (re)create.
