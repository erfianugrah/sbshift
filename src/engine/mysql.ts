/**
 * Minimal MySQL client seam for the DebeziumEngine's source-side queries — the cross-engine
 * reconcile aggregate scan and the cutover write-stop gate (`SHOW MASTER STATUS`). The native-PG
 * path never needs this; only the heterogeneous engine queries a MySQL source directly.
 *
 * pgshift's `connect()` builds Postgres clients only (postgres.js), so a `mysql://` SOURCE_DB_URL
 * cannot be queried through the `source: Db` the ReplicationEngine interface passes — the engine
 * opens its own MySQL connection here instead. Kept behind a tiny interface so callers can be
 * tested with an in-memory fake (no live MySQL in the unit suite).
